# ArtyZ20

There are two ways to use the project on this REPO

1) format a microSD card with two partitions
    - a partition about 0.5GB formatted as FAT32
    - the rest of the SD card set as ext4
2) Copy image.ub and BOOT.BIN into the FAT32 partition
3) copy the image of the filesystem found here - (INSERT LINK HERE) to the second partition of the sd card.
